Plate Manufacturing

I ordered my design plate on sculptero. I ordered a 2mm POM plate to be laser cut. If you can find a 1.5mm plate, get one so the key switches can clip into place.

If you have a large enough print bed, you can also 3D print one with a material of your choice and the files are included. Note that I have not tested it.
