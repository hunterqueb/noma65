# File Use

These files are open and free for you to modify or profit from in any way. Because of my openness for modification, I will not be providing any tutorials for how to use SOLIDWORKS, how to use Autodesk, building the keyboard itself, or placing orders for any materials. I wish for this repo to mearly be a nice framework for anyone already familar with CAD and custom keyboards to freely use these files.
